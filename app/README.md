After completing the device connection workflow, you'll be able to configure other settings.

## Changing the Score Evaluation
The first evaluation option will be chosen automatically. To change the selection, click on the brain icon in the system tray and select an alternative Score option from the list.

> **Note**: Currently, there's only one EEG-related score (Alpha Score) and one HEG-related score (HEG Score). More scores will be added in the future.
